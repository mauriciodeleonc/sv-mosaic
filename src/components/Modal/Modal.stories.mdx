# Modal

The `Modal` component is built over a wrapper for [Material-UI Dialog](https://mui.com/components/dialogs/) but with SimpleView brand colors.

Modals will help to interact with the form to add information and help minimize the length. This action in the modal window will have 
the entire userâ€™s attention. Use only one modal at a time, helping reduce complexity in the interaction.
