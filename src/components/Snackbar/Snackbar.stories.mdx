# Snackbar

The `Snackbar` component is built over a wrapper for [Material-UI Snackbar](https://mui.com/components/snackbars/) but with SimpleView brand colors.

Provide brief messages about some specific actions at the bottom of the screen. Used when creating a form or confirming an action like approving an event. 
Appear without warning, and donâ€™t require user interaction. They automatically disappear from the screen after a minimum of four seconds, and a maximum 
of ten seconds.
