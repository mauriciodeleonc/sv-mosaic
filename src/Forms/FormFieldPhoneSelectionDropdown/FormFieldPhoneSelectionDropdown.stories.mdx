The `FormFieldPhoneSelectionDropdown` component is built over [React-Phone-Input-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-phone-input-2) but with SimpleView brand colors.

The phone selection dropdown is useful when you want to allow users to enter the information of phone numbers, is conformed with the selection of the country in the 
dropdown that contains the country flag, and automatically the prefix and number or characters placeholder are showed.
