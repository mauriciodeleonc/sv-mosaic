# FormFieldRadio

The `FormFieldRadio` component is built over a wrapper for [MUI Radio](https://mui.com/components/radio-buttons/) but with SimpleView brand colors.

- A group of radio buttons allows users to select a single item from a list of possible options.
- All possible options are exposed up front for comparison.
- Users can only make a single selection from the list of possible options.
